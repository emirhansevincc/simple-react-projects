    `Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on Earth. 
    There are a million times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe. 
    Viruses also harbor the majority of genetic diversity on Earth. 
    Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global climate and geochemical cycles. 
    They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. 
    The human genome, for example, contains 100,000 segments of virus DNA.`,
    
    `Piedmont, or mountain, glaciers are found in many parts of the world. 
    In North America they are distributed along the mountain ranges of the Pacific Coast from central California northward. 
    They abound in the Andes range in South America and are familiar and greatly admired spectacles in the Alps, 
    the Pyrenees, the Caucasus Mountains and the mountains of Scandanavia. Rivers of ice flow down the valleys of
    various Asian mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, and the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. 
    They are also a feature of the Southern Alps of New Zealand and are found in the lofty mountains of New Guinea. 
    The largest piedmont glaciers are the Malaspina and Bering glaciers, both in Alaska.`,
    
    `When mice are kept at high population densities, their behaviour changes in a number of ways. 
    Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases. Cannibalism of young 
    also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communal nesting, frequent in natural mouse 
    populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58 mice one to three days old (from several litters) 
    were found in one nest, most unusual communal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted 
    them immediately after birth.`,
    
    `Smoking is defined as a habit of inhaling and exhaling the smoke of tobacco by sucking on the end of a lit cigarette, 
    cigar, pipe, hookah or water pipe etc. No doubt smoking is a bad habit. People can take smoking as a fashion but later 
    it becomes their need and they become so addicted that they do not give it up even if they want to.`,
    
    `There are many types of smoking like cigarettes, cigar, pipe, hookah or water pipe. A cigarette is a thin cylinder 
    containing psychoactive material, mainly tobacco, that is rolled into thin paper for smoking .
    There are more than 7,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. Hundreds are toxic. More than 70 of those chemicals cause cancer. 
    Cigar is also like a cigarette the difference is that in cigar a roll of tobacco wrapped in a tobacco leaf or any substance that contain tobacco.
    Pipe smoking is a practice of inhaling less smoke produced by burning a substance mainly tobacco in a pipe. Hookah is also a kind of a smoking . 
    No matter what kind of smoking you use, all forms of smoking is harmful for health.`,
    
    `Comprehensive measures are needed to stop smoking, First of all, it is necessary to raise public awareness. Schools, 
    colleges and university associations should take effective action against this abominable habit, especially among students.
    Our newspapers, radio, TV channels, films and magazines should raise their voice against it and provide awareness about it. 
    Smoking is becoming more common, especially among young boys and girls, so parents and teachers should sit down with their 
    children and explain the dangers of smoking to them.`
